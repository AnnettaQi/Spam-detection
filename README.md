The repository is about:

Using Python and Spark to perform spam detection.  
There are two tasks:   
The first is to build spam prediction models, using training data sets and stochastic gradient descent (SGD).   The second is to use these models to predict whether the documents in a test data set are spam.
The stochastic gradient descent technique that you will be using is based on [a paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.5168) by Cormack, Smucker and Clarke.
